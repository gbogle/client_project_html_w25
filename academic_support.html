            <h3>Tips for Advising Appointment</h3>
            <p>To make the most of your academic advising experience, here are some tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Choose the Right Service</strong>:  
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1:1 Appointments</strong>: Schedule in advance for detailed questions (15-30 minutes).</li>
                        <li><strong>Drop-in Advising</strong>: No appointment needed; great for quick, time-sensitive questions (first-come, first-served).</li>
                        <li><strong>Email</strong>: Ideal for asynchronous communication. Expect a reply within 24 hours.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>2. Be Aware of Deadlines</strong>:  
                    Keep track of key dates like add/drop deadlines and financial aid deadlines. Schedule appointments early to avoid last-minute issues. Reach out before a problem becomes urgent.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Prepare for Your Appointment</strong>:  
                    Set clear goals for the meeting, review your Degree Audit and Transcript, and make a list of questions. Be on time and avoid distractions during virtual meetings.</li>
                <li><strong>4. Follow Through</strong>:  
                    Complete any action steps suggested by your advisor (e.g., registering for classes, contacting other offices). Reach out if you need further assistance.</li>
            </ul>
